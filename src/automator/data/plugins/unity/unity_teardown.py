"""per_worktree teardown for the bmad-auto Unity engine plugin.

Runs once per unit when the worktree is finished — on success, on a deferral, and
on a pause/escalation — so the unit's managed Unity Editor never outlives its
worktree. Best effort: the engine logs a non-zero exit but the unit's outcome
stands (it does not re-defer a done/paused unit just because Editor-quit failed).

  1. Gracefully quit the worktree's Editor (`unity-mcp-cli close`, then --force).
  2. Fallback hard-kill: if an Editor *or its MCP server* whose argv references this
     worktree is still alive afterwards, SIGTERM→SIGKILL it (Linux). ``close``
     reports success even when it can't find the Editor — which happens precisely
     when readiness failed and the Editor never registered with the MCP — so without
     this a failed unit would leak a live Editor. The Unity plugin also spawns a
     child ``gamedev-mcp-server`` (the local MCP HTTP server) that ``close`` does
     NOT reap; a leaked server holds its port and poisons later runs (the plugin
     declines to start a fresh server when a stale one lingers in the name-keyed
     Library cache), so we sweep it up here too.
  3. Drop the ``<worktree>/Library`` if setup left a *symlink* (the empty-cache
     fallback), leaving the persistent cache it pointed at intact for the next run.
     A real Library — the common case now that setup *primes* a warm reflink/CoW copy
     in — is left untouched; it is removed cheaply when bmad-auto deletes the worktree
     (CoW-shared extents cost almost nothing to drop).

Verified against unity-mcp-cli v0.81.1 (`close <path>` keys off the project path).
Only the IvanMurzak MCP launches a managed per-worktree Editor, so only it is quit
here; for CoplayDev (shared :8080 server) override engine.worktree_teardown_cmd.

Env (injected by the engine):
  BMAD_AUTO_WORKTREE     the worktree whose Editor to quit
  BMAD_AUTO_ENGINE_MCP   ivanmurzak | coplaydev               (default ivanmurzak)
  UNITY_MCP_CLI          IvanMurzak CLI binary                (default unity-mcp-cli)
  BMAD_AUTO_UNITY_CLOSE_TIMEOUT  polite-quit seconds before --force (default 30)

Exit 0 = Editor quit + symlink dropped; non-zero = something failed (logged).
