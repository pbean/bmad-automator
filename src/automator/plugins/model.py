"""Data model for the bmad-auto plugin system.

A plugin extends the orchestrator without touching the core loop. Every plugin
is a ``plugin.toml`` manifest (metadata, declarative out-of-process hooks, a
settings schema, optional in-process Python). Data-only plugins need no code.

This module holds the immutable shapes the manifest parses into plus the
``Plugin`` base class that a trusted in-process plugin subclasses. It mirrors
the proven dataclass-as-data style of ``engines/plugin.py`` and
``adapters/profile.py`` — parsing/validation lives in ``manifest.py``,
discovery in ``loader.py``, trust in ``trust.py`` and aggregation in
``registry.py``. Nothing here reaches into the run loop; the hook bus that
calls into a plugin is wired in a later phase.

    a plugin's resolved settings can override two of these fields by naming

      * ``<name>_enabled`` (bool) — when explicitly ``false``, the step is

      * ``<name>_blocking`` (bool) — overrides this spec's ``blocking`` flag,
        flipping the advisory/defer behaviour without editing the manifest.

    ``<name>`` is this workflow's ``name``; declare matching ``[[settings]]`` so
    operators can flip them from ``[plugins.<plugin>]`` in policy.toml. Absent
    settings preserve the manifest values exactly — a plugin that declares none
